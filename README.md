# DESIVAST

DESIVAST is a void catalog creation and analysis pipeline for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Survey. DESIVAST uses the [Void Analysis Software Toolkit](https://github.com/DESI-UR/VAST/tree/master) and [vast_tools](https://github.com/hbrincon/vast_tools) to create value added void catalogs with DESI tracers. Running DESIVAST requires access to the shared DESI collaboration data on NERSC.
