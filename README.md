# DESIVAST

DESIVAST is a void catalog creation and analysis pipeline for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Survey. DESIVAST uses the [Void Software and Analysis Toolkit][https://github.com/DESI-UR/VAST/tree/master] to create value added void catalogs with DESI tracers. Running DESIVAST requires access to the shared DESI collaboration data on NERSC.
